This is an app that was made as part of: "HF4Y 34 - Developing Mobile Web Based Applications: An Introduction"

This was a module which was part of my [HNC Computing](https://www.perth.uhi.ac.uk/courses/hnc-computing/) Course. 

At the time of making, I had already been writing Python as a hobby for 2 - 3 years, so I decided against using the 'app builder' my college suggested, and went for the 'hardcore' approach and wrote the program myself using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

Features of this app:
- Password Generator (1 - 32 Characters, Number Only, Special Char Only, Letters Only or All)
- Password Recording / Storing (AES256 Encryption, Google Firebase Connection)

*This app was my first ever Java & Mobile app project, the UI isn't great, but it is functional, which was the goal!*
